This is a monte carlo simulation code to calculate a solid angle and a distance for fan-shape material.
The position of material is defined by a shortest distance and elevation angle from the center of the fan-shape to generated position.

To calculate the "Solid angle",
You run ". simulation.sh", then you can get the result with "result.csv".

To calculate the "Distance",
You run "./distance", then you can get the result with "distance.txt".
